# Welcome to Building with Cognitive Services: Bing Search, Bots V4 SDK and Custom Vision

We will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in Azure Cognitive Services including Computer Vision, Custom Vision, LUIS, and Bing Search. You will also learn to leverage other AI-oriented services such as the Azure Bot Services. These labs assume an introductory knowledge of these services.

> Note: This is a recommended **one-day** agenda, with the goal of getting the deltas of the full two-day course from what it was in June 2018. Because of that, this course only includes labs that are net new or have changed drastically - Bots, Bing Search, and Custom Vision. If you're interested in the full two-day course, please refer to the main [README](../README.md).

## Goals

Most challenges observed by customers in these realms are in stitching multiple services together. As such, where possible, we have tried to place key concepts in the context of broader examples.

At the end of this 300-level workshop, you should be able to:

- Build an application that calls various Cognitive Services APIs (specifically Bing Search, Computer Vision, LUIS and Custom Vision)
- For Cognitive Services, determine what to use when and how to combine multiple to increase the intelligence and capabilities of bots/apps
- Build, train, and publish a LUIS model to help your bot communicate effectively
- Build an intelligent bot using Microsoft Bot Framework that leverages LUIS and Azure Search
- Effectively leverage the custom vision service to create object detection services that can then be leveraged by an application

## Agenda

Please note: This is a rough agenda, and the schedule is subject to change pending class activities and interaction. Also note that the numbering here will not always be the same as the numbering in the references. This airlift is a combination of several courses.
