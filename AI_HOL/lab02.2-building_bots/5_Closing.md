## Lab Completion

In this lab we covered creating an intelligent bot from end-to-end using the Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure Search and several Cognitive Services.

You should have learned:
- How to weave intelligent services into your applications
- How to implement Azure Search features to provide a positive search experience inside an application
- How to configure an Azure Search service to extend your data to enable full-text, language-aware search
- How to build, train and publish a LUIS model to help your bot communicate effectively
- How to build an intelligent bot using Microsoft Bot Framework that leverages LUIS and Azure Search  

In the next lab, we'll talk about additions to a bot that's already been deployed; you'll add Bing Search to your bot. In supplementary labs, you can learn more about logging and testing bots, as well as how to design and architect intelligent agents.
