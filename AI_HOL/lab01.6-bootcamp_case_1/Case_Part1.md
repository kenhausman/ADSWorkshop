# Bootcamp Case

## Scenario

You've been assigned a new customer, Contoso LLC, which sells bicycles and bicycle equipment to its customers. Contoso currently processes new product orders and queries through human operators. They are looking for an automated solution that allows Contoso to seamlessly scale up to handle large call volumes while maintaining zero wait times and freeing up staff to manage other tasks.

## Architecture

Your team recently presented a potential architecture (below) that Contoso LLC approved.

* [Skype Client](https://www.skype.com/)  
User initiates call
* [Bot Connector](https://dev.botframework.com/) + [Skype Calling Channel](https://dev.skype.com/bots)

* [Azure App Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)  
Hosts the bot application, which manages logic and API calls
* [Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/)  
Stores bot state and event logs
* [Speech Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech/home)
Processes speech-to-text
* [LUIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/LUIS/Home)  (Language Understanding Intelligent Service)  
Extracts intent and entities from text
* [Azure Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/)  
Indexes the product catalog for product-query matching
* [Azure SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/)  
Stores product and order data
* [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/)  
Stores bot audio data for debugging

## Day 1 Assignment

Your team is preparing a proof of concept, and your group has been tasked to suggest answersÂ to the following questions:

1. What might your main intents in LUIS be?  
2. Are there any additional Cognitive Services that you think could be used to help bring value to the business?
3. What are some potential ideas for how Custom Vision could be used to bring value?

Document your suggestions on the whiteboards/flipcharts provided. You will present your results.
